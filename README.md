**NOTE: We're still building the Readme files for Aegis.**

Installing Aegis:

- Go 1.11 or higher installed
- `$GOPATH` set
- Have `~/.aws/credentials` and `~/.aws/config` setup (or some other form of [AWS authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-go/v1/developer-guide/configuring-sdk.html#specifying-credentials))

## Have ready

- Credentials for all API accounts
- An enumeration of the asset groups you plan on rescanning (comma separated)
- AWS KMS encryption key
  - Must be `symmetric`

### Nexpose

- Templates for your vulnerability/discovery scans existing in your Nexpose instance and their IDs
- Nexpose site ID (integer) that you will be using for vulnerability rescans

### Qualys

- SearchList and OptionProfile for your vulnerability scans in your Qualys instance and their integer IDs
- OptionProfile for your discovery scans in your Qualys instance and it's integer ID
- A list of all the group IDs that require external scanners (comma separated)

### JIRA

- The project key for the project you plan on storing tickets
- If using your own ticket transition workflow/ticket schema, mapping must be done in the JIRA source config
- (optional) a separate CERF project for tickets that remediators create for tracking exceptions and false-positives
- (optional) JIRA supports Oauth, if you have Oauth credentials, they can be set in the JIRA source config in the database after installation

### Database

- Create a schema in your database for Aegis to utilize

## Installation

```sh
cd $GOPATH/src
mkdir -p github.com
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com
mkdir -p nortonlifelock
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/nortonlifelock

git clone https://github.com/nortonlifelock/aegis
git clone https://github.com/nortonlifelock/aegis-scaffold.git
git clone https://github.com/nortonlifelock/aegis-api.git
git clone https://github.com/nortonlifelock/aegis-db.git
git clone https://github.com/nortonlifelock/aegis-ui.git

cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/nortonlifelock/aegis
go install aegis.go

cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/nortonlifelock/aegis-api || exit
go install aegis-api.go

cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/nortonlifelock/aegis-scaffold || exit
go install aegis-scaffold.go

aegis init
```

## Running Aegis

```sh
aegis â€“cpath $GOPATH/src/github.com/nortonlifelock
```



- Step 0: Create a JIRA project for vulnerability management by Aegis
- Step 1: Create the database schema for Aegis (*we use Aegis*)
- Step 2: Execute the Aegis Scaffold (github.com/nortonlifelock/aegis-scaffold)
- Step 3: Setup your Aegis Configuration File

Base Json Configuration File: 
```json
{
  "db_path":"127.0.0.1",
  "db_port":"3306",
  "db_username":"",
  "db_password":"",
  "db_schema": "Aegis",

  "logpath":"",

  "key_id":"",
  "sns_id":"",
  "kms_region": "",
  "kms_profile": "",

  "log_to_console":true,
  "log_to_db":true,
  "log_to_file":true,
  "log_no_delete": true,
  "debug":true,

  "api_port":4040,
  "websocket_protocol":"wss",
  "transport_protocol":"https",
  "ui_location":"localhost:4200",

  "path_to_aegis": ""
}
```

The install-config script will generate this application config with your input and name the file app.json. The purpose of each field are as follows:
```
# Configurations used for the Aegis jobs
db_path
    The URL or IP address where your database resides
db_port
    The port on which your database listens
db_username
    The username that is used to authenticate against the database
db_password
    The (encrypted) password that is used to authenticate against the database
    The password is encrypted with the KMS key you provide by the install-config scirpt
db_schema
    The name of the schema that Aegis will utilize

logpath
    The path at which the logs are stored

key_id
    The ID of the (symmetric) KMS key that is used for the encryption
kms_region
    The region (e.g. us-east-1/us-west-1) that the KMS key lies in
kms_profile (optional)
    If using file authentication for AWS (~/.aws/credentials) that contains multiple profiles, you can specify which one here
sns_id (optional)
    The ID of the SNS topic that is used to publish critical/fatal logs

log_to_console
    Boolean controlling whether logs are printed to the console
log_to_db
    Boolean controlling whether logs are stored in the database 
log_to_file
    Boolean controlling whether logs are written to log files
log_no_delete
    Boolean controlling whether logs stored in files are deleted after a day
debug
    Boolean controlling whether debug logs are processed
 
# Configurations used by the Aegis API
api_port
    The port on which the Aegis API listens
websocket_protocol
    The protocol that is used for websocket connections [ws|wss]    
transport_protocol
    The protocol that is used for http connections [http|https]
ui_location
    The URL that the API lies at (used to check the origin header of HTTP requests)
path_to_aegis
    The path where the Aegis system is stored
```

- Step 4: Execute Aegis
```
aegis -config app.json -cpath "path to configuration file"
```
